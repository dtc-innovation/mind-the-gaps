# mind-the-gaps

Mind the Gaps is an **experiment** to bring citizen sensing closer to policy making. It is a **system** for open data collection about well-being and inequalities in cities.

We invite citizens to **paint a more comprehensive** picture of their experience of their neighbourhood.

It complements existing datasets with qualitative data at a neighbourhood level. This will aim to stimulate open discussions and help policy makers build more resilient cities.
