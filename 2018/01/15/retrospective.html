  <li>I enjoyed the space for us to work.</li>
  <li>I enjoyed collaborative coding and publication</li>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/bristol-mapping-inequality.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="disliked">Disliked</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I had the feeling the meeting with the Mayorâ€™s office people was planned too early in the week, and too high level at this stage</li>
  <li>I am not sure we are going to have enough time to properly address a problem which is so big</li>
  <li>I would have felt more confident if I had done more researched and prepared in depth questions</li>
  <li>I would have liked more â€˜doingâ€™</li>
  <li>Too much milk in the tea :/</li>
  <li>I felt the day was jam-packed and we lacked time to do things as a team, like summarising interview notes</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="learned">Learned</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I learned about Bristol, general knowledge about the city, the neighbourhoods</li>
  <li>I learned about the data collection that Bristol does as a city</li>
  <li>I learned about Bristol communities</li>
  <li>I learned the shape of the field we are working in.</li>
  <li>I enjoyed learning about positive things found in the data of the most deprived areas.</li>
  <li>I learned more about the variety of topics and wards we could have an impact on.</li>
  <li>I learned about policy making. I learned there is room for improvement in ways they do that</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="tomorrow">Tomorrow</h1>

<ul>
  <li>To meet with the Pervasive Media Studio folks</li>
  <li>To see the city</li>
  <li>To start defining a more specific purpose/object of the project; what is realistic to do in the days to come</li>
  <li>To keep working with the team</li>
  <li>To create a draft of documentation structure</li>
  <li>To create something</li>
  <li>To speak to people on the other side: communities, activistsâ€¦(+3)</li>
  <li>To go to the Open Data Meetup and see the audience there.</li>
  <li>To do more documentation together.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="blockers--slowdowners--whatevers">Blockers / Slowdowners / Whatevers</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I feel slowed down by not knowing enough the content of the various surveys</li>
  <li>I donâ€™t feel at ease with slight different visions for the product</li>
  <li>The scope of the field is huge ðŸ˜“</li>

      <p>Mind the Gaps is a thought provoking <strong>experiment</strong> to bring citizen sensing closer to policy making. It is a <strong>system</strong> for open data collection about well-being and inequalities in cities.</p>

<p>It will invite citizens to <strong>paint a more comprehensive picture</strong> of their experience of their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It adds qualitative and granular data to existing robust datasets.
This will aim to stimulate open discussions and help policy makers build more resilient cities.</p>
