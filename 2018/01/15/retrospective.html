   <p>Here are the questions we asked to ourselves after the end of the day 1 of our work week:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What did you enjoy today?</li>
  <li>What did you dislike today?</li>
  <li>what did you learn today?</li>
  <li>what would you like to do tomorrow?</li>
  <li>do you think something is blocking you at the moment?</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="enjoyed">Enjoyed</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I liked the City Hall building</li>
  <li>I liked the people we met ‚Äì we had more insights about what to expect, about the Quality of Life Survey (+2)</li>
  <li>I liked the general feeling of working together (+2)</li>
  <li>I enjoyed getting an understanding of the people working on those issues in local government and beyond</li>
  <li>I enjoyed the face to face sessions/interviews</li>
  <li>I enjoyed the closeness of the relationships of people we met today, people who aren‚Äôt necessarily from the same departments.</li>
  <li>I enjoyed the availability and dedication of the people we met.</li>
  <li>I enjoyed the space for us to work.</li>
  <li>I enjoyed collaborative coding and publication</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/mind-the-gaps/assets/posts/bristol-mapping-inequality.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="disliked">Disliked</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I had the feeling the meeting with the Mayor‚Äôs office people was planned too early in the week, and too high level at this stage</li>
  <li>I am not sure we are going to have enough time to properly address a problem which is so big</li>
  <li>I would have felt more confident if I had done more researched and prepared in depth questions</li>
  <li>I would have liked more ‚Äòdoing‚Äô</li>
  <li>Too much milk in the tea :/</li>
  <li>I felt the day was jam-packed and we lacked time to do things as a team, like summarising interview notes</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="learned">Learned</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I learned about Bristol, general knowledge about the city, the neighbourhoods</li>
  <li>I learned about the data collection that Bristol does as a city</li>
  <li>I learned about Bristol communities</li>
  <li>I learned the shape of the field we are working in.</li>
  <li>I enjoyed learning about positive things found in the data of the most deprived areas.</li>
  <li>I learned more about the variety of topics and wards we could have an impact on.</li>
  <li>I learned about policy making. I learned there is room for improvement in ways they do that</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="tomorrow">Tomorrow</h1>

<ul>
  <li>To meet with the Pervasive Media Studio folks</li>
  <li>To see the city</li>
  <li>To start defining a more specific purpose/object of the project; what is realistic to do in the days to come</li>
  <li>To keep working with the team</li>
  <li>To create a draft of documentation structure</li>
  <li>To create something</li>
  <li>To speak to people on the other side: communities, activists‚Ä¶(+3)</li>
  <li>To go to the Open Data Meetup and see the audience there.</li>
  <li>To do more documentation together.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="blockers--slowdowners--whatevers">Blockers / Slowdowners / Whatevers</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I feel slowed down by not knowing enough the content of the various surveys</li>
  <li>I don‚Äôt feel at ease with slight different visions for the product</li>
  <li>The scope of the field is huge üòì</li>
