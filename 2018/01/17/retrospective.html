<h1 id="dislike--improve">Dislike / Improve</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I did not enjoy lunchtime because of the language barrier ‚Äì it‚Äôs not fixable in a way, and the group helped getting a shared understanding</li>
  <li>I was worried to go to Knowles West Centre after lunch ‚Äì we did fix it by staying at the Watershed and with <a href="/https://dtc-innovation.github.io/mind-the-gaps/2018/01/17/8-sketches-workshop.html">this workshop</a></li>
  <li>I can get lost in complexity, I get anxious about, and I don‚Äôt know how to talk about it</li>
  <li>I am not sure there is a direct bridge to solve <em>the</em> problem‚Ä¶ I feel it is a good idea, I do not know it is <em>the</em> good idea ‚Äì I‚Äôd like to improve how to communicate that</li>
  <li>I lack 30 minutes per day to do some writing down individually ‚Äì I‚Äôd like to make some time for that tomorrow</li>
  <li>I felt a bit vulnerable when I had to explain the drawings, I felt I was overexplaining ‚Äì I will trust the exercise more next time because you backed me up, and ask</li>
  <li>I did not drink enough tea‚Ä¶</li>
  <li>I disliked making too much rice! üçö ‚Äî next time, I‚Äôll listen to Al(a)in(e)</li>
