    <p>Here are the questions we asked to ourselves after the end of the day 2 of our work week:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What did you enjoy/are the most proud of today?</li>
  <li>What would you like to do differently tomorrow?</li>
  <li>Any action/things youâ€™d like to do tomorrow?</li>
  <li>Is there something slowing you down?</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="enjoy">Enjoy</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Sharing the datavisualization links â€“ diversity of forms, got a feeling of what could be done, inspiration (+3)</li>
  <li>Guerilla interviews were nice (+2)</li>
  <li>End of day recap session was helpful for the team and for me (+3)</li>
  <li>Tea was better \o/</li>
  <li>Seeing the city a little bit more, going to the community centre and meet more with people (+1)</li>
  <li>Getting a feeling of the data community (+1)</li>
  <li>The mapping! Getting the feeling that I was able to materialise our thoughts on paper. (+2)</li>
  <li>Enjoyed the team dynamic in our last session before the event.</li>
  <li>Enjoyed going out in the field to sense and learn more about community centres. It changed my view and makes me feel more informed.</li>
  <li>I enjoy that we take time to do things.</li>
  <li>I enjoyed getting news from a friend I hadnâ€™t heard of in months. Made me feel warm inside all day long. :)))</li>
  <li>Fishâ€™n chips. (+1)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="improve--dislike">Improve / Dislike</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Morning session felt a bit slow â€” could have been more productive: when we do a doc session, rehash our individual notes</li>
  <li>Transportation time: get bikes or bus or else</li>
  <li>I disliked not concluding a session to get something out of it _ even though we were not responsible for it</li>
  <li>I disliked not being able to hear Alaine on the way back: ask to repeat or delay the conversation</li>
  <li>Confused to witness the interactions and diversity of challenges within the open data community.</li>
  <li>I felt I lacked availability this morning and feel we could set out with clear session rules to improve outputs.</li>
  <li>I disliked being grumpy during the morning because of an exterior event and the impact it might have had on the group.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="do">Do</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Post Mind the Gaps website link on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Bristol_Open_Data/events/246491284/">Open Data Bristol Meetup Group</a></li>
  <li>More interviews in the community</li>
  <li>Interview community leaders</li>
  <li>Interview people working in tech and open data in Bristol (privately or publicly, not necessarily involved with the City Council)</li>
  <li>To identify and outline the processes involved in the output â€” eg: researching in the datasets to pinpoint interesting narratives/journeys and what are the steps to get a reasonable output</li>
  <li>To solidify what we talked about between 5pm and 6pm (+1)</li>
  <li>To refine our project hypotheses (+1)</li>
  <li>To paper prototype our impressions of the 5-6pm session.</li>
  <li>To have a look at datasets (+1)</li>
  <li>To identify other public citizen advocacy with a good use of open data</li>
  <li>To visit the Dome</li>
  <li>To see Victoria (+2)</li>
  <li>To read the surveys</li>
  <li>To look at the documentation we received today from Phil</li>
  <li>To transform Alaineâ€™s map into a graph</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="slowing-me-down">Slowing me down</h1>

<ul>
  <li>We lack of chocolate :/</li>
  <li>Worried about time (+1)</li>
  <li>Worried we wonâ€™t have the time to produce a prototype in time (for Friday)</li>
  <li>Bad news from this morning</li>
</ul>

      <p>Mind the Gaps is a thought provoking <strong>experiment</strong> to bring citizen sensing closer to policy making. It is a <strong>system</strong> for open data collection about well-being and inequalities in cities.</p>

<p>It will invite citizens to <strong>paint a more comprehensive picture</strong> of their experience of their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It adds qualitative and granular data to existing robust datasets.
This will aim to stimulate open discussions and help policy makers build more resilient cities.</p>
