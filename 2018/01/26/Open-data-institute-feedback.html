    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>A catch-up with Tom Hunter (Innovation Consultant at the ODI) and Miranda Marcus (R&amp;D manager at the ODI) with the material produced during the work week in Bristol.</p>

<p>Tom Hunter manages the development of the three mini-grants focused on France / UK collaborations.</p>

<p>Project shift and grant boundaries.</p>

<p><strong>See our presentation <a href="https://dtc-innovation.github.io/mind-the-gaps/2018/01/26/work-week-conclusions.html">here</a></strong></p>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>

<p>The Open Data Institute manifested their interest in understanding the political aspect of the project.</p>

<p>Political sensitivities are also at the crux of the other projects being developed with the grants and understanding these could be very valuable material for the ODI going forward.</p>

<p>They mentioned that to take the project to the next step (testing a prototype) we would need to get buy-in from cities, which might represent a lot of work.  â€” seems like it was difficult for Bristol.</p>

<p>For them, he most exciting part in the initial proposal was to highlight the pathways to resolution. A valuable output of our research could also be to map why we didnâ€™t develop this axis in a report as this is a common misconception among leaders and coders and therefore a valuable thing to have evidenced.</p>

<p>(The challenge is every local government is going to have a different structure. This makes the project non-replicable.)</p>

<p>We mentioned we saw great value and innovation in citizen sensing approaches â€” in data literacy, understanding the implications, in activism goals and in the variety of data sources the council takes into account to inform policy making.</p>

<p>We chose to focus on how we could encourage and develop these initiatives, particularly around inequalities / quality of life / wellbeing in cities.</p>

<p>So how can we make citizen sensing helpful and present to civil servants? How can we help them see the value of this?</p>

<p>Examples of a City dashboard and the Airbnb experience map.</p>

<p>The ODI is particularly interested in the Bristol-Bordeaux twin city duo.</p>

<p>Suggested output for the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rich ethnographic research</li>
  <li>Prototype with user research</li>
  <li>Reflective report with a clearly outlined research methodology.</li>
</ul>

<p>They liked our open documentation and our project orientation.</p>

<p><strong>Next steps</strong>:</p>

<p>Prototype and test / make links with different communities.</p>

<p>Pursue work in France, test in Bordeaux and see why there has been resistance to the project, or if there are other doors that could be opened?</p>

<p><strong>Next catch up</strong></p>

<p>Friday Feb. 9th 4-5pm.</p>

<p><strong>Deadlines</strong></p>

<p>End of Feb. End of March is the hard stop for everything.</p>

      <p>Mind the Gaps is a thought provoking <strong>experiment</strong> to bring citizen sensing closer to policy making. It is a <strong>system</strong> for open data collection about well-being and inequalities in cities.</p>

<p>It will invite citizens to <strong>paint a more comprehensive picture</strong> of their experience of their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It adds qualitative and granular data to existing robust datasets.
This will aim to stimulate open discussions and help policy makers build more resilient cities.</p>
