   <p>Why is it important that <em>Mind the Gaps</em> has zero running costs?</p>

<p>We believe it can become a useful tool for citizens, for local governments and for charities.
We think we can achieve this <em>Mind the Gaps</em> is <strong>open</strong> and exists in the <strong>commons</strong>.</p>

<p>If some costs are associated with running the project, there are two main problems for us:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The projects dies at the end of this round of funding.</li>
  <li>Its shape may be influenced or nudged by funders.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="how-do-we-make-this-happen">How do we make this happen?</h1>

<p>We rely on free and simple features of widely used products.
We mostly use <a href="https://github,com">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>, <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a>, <a href="https://typeform.com">Typeform</a>, <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a> for collaboration and for our infrastructure.</p>

<p>Doing an <strong>Open Source project</strong> within a <strong>not-for-profit company</strong> removes a lot of barriers by unlocking premium features of the above listed products.</p>

<h1 id="co-design-with-communities">Co-Design with Communities</h1>

<p>Involving Bristol and Bordeaux City Hall, community leaders and citizens in the design and development process right from the start means the project can spread naturally, without paid promotion.</p>

<p>The toolbox is being built <em>with</em> them and <em>for</em> them.</p>

<p>The domain name (<code class="highlighter-rouge">mind-the-gaps.org</code>) is the only running cost.
It is a yearly fee of ¬£6 ‚Äì even if we do not manage to get additional funding, it is affordable to renew it with our personal or company money without much trouble.</p>

<h1 id="governance">Governance</h1>

<p>People we met and talked on the field <strong>trust</strong> us because we are <strong>independant</strong>, <strong>non-commercial</strong> and <strong>open</strong>.</p>

<p>We are sustainable by being free and by having no operational cost.
It enables us to talk to people with no commercial intent.
Being a non-commercial product makes people at ease, they are usually happy to participate in our project.
We were happily surprised to see them giving us time and information.
Being commercial was a real barrier to people sharing with us.</p>

<p>From a design perspective, not paying for anything makes <strong>free to evolve</strong> to whatever solution works best for our needs.
We are <strong>not locked</strong> into services we have paid for.</p>

<h1 id="project-pace">Project pace</h1>

<p>We can embrace the fact that good things take time to be built.</p>

<p>As we are not locked in to a product plan for a set time period, we can go and work on other projects to sustain our lives.
When the next funding opportunity arises, we can continue working where we left off, without wasting money.</p>
