   <p>While conducting the first research phase of <em>Mind the Gaps</em>, we made <strong>a concious decision to not ask for personal data</strong> in the survey.</p>

<p>We made this decision for <strong>privacy</strong> and for <strong>user experience</strong> reasons.</p>

<p>The only form of identification we ask for is the <em>neighbourhood</em> location. There is the administrative neighbouhood and the perceived neighbouhood. The people we talked to defaulted to the perceived neighbouhood.</p>

<h1 id="why-not-asking-for-a-postcode">Why not asking for a postcode?</h1>

<p>We could ask for the postcode in the UK. They look like <code class="highlighter-rouge">BS3 4ND</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">BS</code> represents the town</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code> represents the ward</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">4ND</code> represents a smaller area, like a street or a block of houses</li>
</ul>

<p>Although British postcodes are easy to validate, they could breach respondants privacy… when the postcode includes only one address for example.</p>

<p>In France, postcodes are an entirely different story.
They look like <code class="highlighter-rouge">33000</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">33</code> represents the county (<em>département</em>—an administrative layer in between cities and regions)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">000</code> represents the city</li>
</ul>

<p>Postcodes are broad and encompass a city or a city administrative district (Paris, Lyon and Marseille only). <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8Elots_regroup%C3%A9s_pour_l%27information_statistique">IRIS codes</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONS_coding_system#Neighbourhood_Statistics_Geography">LSOA</a> equivalents) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INSEE_code">INSEE codes</a> exist but nobody on the street knows about them.</p>

<p>French postcodes won’t tell you <em>which part of the city we’re talking about</em> unless you have a postal address. But then, asking for a postal address can be precise enough in term of person identification.</p>

<p>So in the end <strong>we ask only about the <em>neighbouhood</em></strong>. Which is easy to ask in a conversational form. It’s like asking where you come from.</p>

<h1 id="interpretation-bias">Interpretation Bias</h1>

<p>One reason there is no gender, no age and no ethnicity in our questions is because <strong>we do not want to influence how responses can be understood</strong>.</p>

<p>We don’t want a response to be discarded because the respondant is “too old” or “too young”. If the “age” does not matter as such, the bias is introduced by the <em>belief associated with “age”</em>.</p>

<p>We want responses to be treated equally thus we don’t ask for these personal details. This ensures <strong>analysis are not skewed with our own bias</strong>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, personal details do not make a difference with how you perceive your neighbourhood.</p>

<h1 id="trade-off">Trade-off</h1>

<p>We know by doing such, we would not be able to address specific demographic issues (eg: women safety by night).
We would not be able to segment our data by demographics.</p>

<p>A way to work around the absence of personal data would be to join <em>Mind the Gaps</em> data with neighbouhood demographic data.</p>

<h1 id="user-experience-matters">User experience matters</h1>

<p>It is not a great user experience to have to self define ourselves, either in a conversation on the stret or on an online survey. Why would we have to say we are caucasian white? Why shall we state our gender?</p>

<p>Because the <em>Mind the Gaps</em> project is more about <strong>communicating signals</strong>,
we embraced our principles by asking only neighbouhood informations.</p>

<h1 id="subjectivity">Subjectivity</h1>

<p>Feelings are subjective. They are real. But they are tight to each person which express them. Hence the <em>subjectivity</em>.</p>

<p>Making the choice to not ask for personal data is also a way to avoid the complex intrication of subjectivity: shall we have to think differently about a subjective opinion because of these details?</p>

<p>We’d rather not. So <strong>it’s about removing another layer of subjective reading</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Individuals and their opinions are considered as equals at the survey/form level directly. Equality of analysis is built-in, by design.</p>
