## Documentation

This website acts as a living documentation of _what is happening_, _what we are thinking about_ and _what is being produced_.

## Discussions

Discussions are available as [open web archive][framalist]. Subscription is open to all.

## Kick Off Work Week

We ran a collective work week in Bristol from Jan 15th to Jan 19th 2018.

The collective was formed of 4 persons:

* [Alaine Burns](https://www.behance.net/OrangegnarO)
* [No√©mie Girard](http://noemiegirard.co)
* [Romain Crestey](https://github.com/ioiurson) ([drawings](https://cargocollective.com/ourson))
* [Thomas Parisot](https://dtc-innovation.org)

This is how [we spent our time][timeplanner].

## Accountability

We value public money and thus, we want to be transparent on how we spent it to develop the project.

## Code

No code has been produced yet. We're investigating the _why_ and the _how_ at the moment.
