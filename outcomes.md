## Documentation

This website acts as a living documentation of _what is happening_, _what we are thinking about_ and _what is being produced_.

## Newsletters

We send project updates once in a while. [Subscribe to them](#subscribe).

## Research Week

Our data collective ran a work week in Bristol from Jan 15th to Jan 19th 2018.

The collective was formed of 4 persons:

* [Alaine Burns](https://www.behance.net/OrangegnarO)
* [No√©mie Girard](http://noemiegirard.co)
* [Romain Crestey](https://github.com/ioiurson) ([drawings](https://cargocollective.com/ourson))
* [Thomas Parisot](https://dtc-innovation.org)

This is how [we spent our time][timeplanner].

## Accountability

We value public money and thus, we want to be transparent on how we spent it to develop the project.

{% include table.html data=site.data.spendings.odi-grant %}

## Code

No code is being produced. A prototype will come with Phase II of the project.
