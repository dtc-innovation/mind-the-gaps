## Kick Off Work Week

We ran a collective work week in Bristol from Jan 15th to Jan 19th 2018.

The collective was formed of 4 persons:

* [Alaine Burns](https://www.behance.net/OrangegnarO)
* [No√©mie Girard](http://noemiegirard.co)
* [Romain Crestey](https://github.com/ioiurson) ([drawings](https://cargocollective.com/ourson))
* [Thomas Parisot](https://dtc-innovation.org)

## Code

No code has been produced yet. We're investigating the _why_ and the _how_ at the moment.
