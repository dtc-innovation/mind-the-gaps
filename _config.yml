title: Mind the Gaps
email: mind-the-gaps@framalistes.org
description: |
  Mind the Gaps is a thought provoking **experiment** to bring citizen sensing closer to policy making. It is a **system** for open data collection about well-being and inequalities in cities.

  It will invite citizens to **paint a more comprehensive picture** of their experience of their neighbourhood.

  It adds qualitative and granular data to existing robust datasets.
  This will aim to stimulate open discussions and help policy makers build more resilient cities.
