title: Mind the Gaps
description: |
  Mind the Gaps is an **experiment** to bring citizen sensing closer to policy making. It is a **system** for open data collection about well-being and inequalities in cities.

  We invite citizens to **paint a more comprehensive** picture of their experience of their neighbourhood.

  It complements existing datasets with qualitative data at a neighbourhood level. This will aim to stimulate open discussions and help policy makers build more resilient cities.

  We are an **independant data collective** of researchers, artists, developers and ethnographers.
  We are based in France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and MontrÃ©al ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.

  The project is backed by the non-profit cooperative
  [dtc innovation](https://dtc-innovation.org).
  We do not track nor collect any personal data.
  And will never do, not even for money.
