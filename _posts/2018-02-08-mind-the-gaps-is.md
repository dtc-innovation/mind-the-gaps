The intent of this workshop was to ideate around the goals, the meaning and the representation of what _Mind the Gaps_ is for us.

It works by one of us starting the sentence by "Mind the Gaps is…" and by saying a word. The person next to them would say another word, and so until someone says "fullstop".
When it happens, the sentence is considered as _finished_ and we start a new round of collaborative ideation.

* a framework to understand discrepencies between feelings of citizens and policy makers #democracy
* a system to collect, visualise and educate citizens and local governments about data and its complexities.
* a sensitive approach to data commons which incorporates citizen sensing, open data and a mindful understanding of well-being in the cithey #babam!

We then listed 3 words we found representative what _Mind the Gaps_ is about:

- thought provoking
- inform
- engaging
- co-design
- people focused
- politically sensitive
- cold data
- invisible
- resilience

We bounced on these words to write several _one liners_. We then collated our trials into the following and satisfying description of the project:

> Mind the Gaps is a thought provoking _experiment_ to bring citizen sensing closer to policy making. It is a _system_ for open data collection about well-being and inequalities in cities.
>
> It will invite citizens to paint a more comprehensive picture of their experience of their neighbourhood.
>
> It adds qualitative and granular data to existing robust datasets.
> This will aim to stimulate open discussions and help policy makers build more resilient cities.
