title: Updated Design Sprint RSVP
---

The initial kick-off proposal failed to 2 reasons:

1. Thomas acknowledges he had not maintained the momentum;
2. Details around the organisation of the kick-off were fuzzy.

Stating the kick-off is organised as a _Design Sprint_ might have helped. It is a reference point people can refer to.

Kick-off is now moving from December to January. Please RSVP with the following Doodle:
