Patricia Holley, Manager of the Jean Golding Institute

Interdisciplinary research - bringing different research areas together.   
Within the University of Bristol, there are many institutes dedicated to this type of research: 

• [Cabot Institute](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cabot/) - Environment and sustainability research.
Helped establish interdisciplinary research internally but also instigates external

• [Elizabeth Blackwell Institute](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/blackwell/) - Health - Wellcome Trust - skill building
Promoting psychologists, engineers, social researchers…

• [Brigstow Institute](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/brigstow/) - Researching new ways of living and being (living well with mental health, dying well)...

• [Jean Golding Institute](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/) - Over-arching institute. Big data, complex data. Data sharing ethics, how can we use data to support research.

Alspac study - epidemiological cohort. Pregnant women and children were studied. Teeth, DNA, environmental background, social environment. Multi-generational cohort.

Mothers are super invested in sharing back data but the study was invested in following data from fathers.

Pr. Jean Golding is following that study project, she was a mathematician initially but broadened her skills. The institute is named after her.

• Manager - Patricia Holley  
• Data Science Specialist - Bobby Stuijfzand - Helps researchers to find new ways to analyse data.   
• Research Coordinator - Liz Green  

New initiative: they were founded a year and a half ago.

**Goals:**
* Building communities interested in different aspects of data
* Encourage multi-disciplinary analysis of data.
* Support the Council’s open data program. Ways of collaboration.

They organise events, theme events, data competitions, networking events...
Winners of the competition developed an app that could predict traffic and adapt your behaviour accordingly. Trying to take this further but not easy with a small team.

A ‘smart city’ is data-driven but also people-focused.

She mentioned we could meet with Sarah Toy from the Bristol Resilience strategy.

One of the biggest challenges in the field is mapping community initiatives.

No one knows who is doing what.

**Examples of ongoing work / research:**

* Using data visualisation to track animals in the wild
* Family practices in low income areas. Donate the data to investigate how that affects income in houses.
* International symposium in global research challenges.

**Examples of Bristol-led projects:**

* Inventory of health data sets.
* KWMC - damp data. Upskilling local community initiatives like these so they can be replicated.

**Data community in Bristol**

* Engine shed 
Supports the growth of SMEs that come from the research.
Business incubator - one of the best in the world.
Training for young entrepreneurs - good connection with investors. 

**Examples of innovative uses of data:** 

* Helen Manchester - Tangible memories. Have data embedded into things. Rocking chair that talks.
* Workshop to come on a haptic approach of sharing data 
* Sensors for healthcare - Sphere
* IoT object would study behaviour of people at home - health conditions. Parkinson / does your medication dose need to change? Deployed in 60 houses in Bristol.
Developed in partnership with KWMC because they have great access to communities. Importance of trust in these ventures. Invasiness of having the object at home and it analysing your behaviour, affect your life…
