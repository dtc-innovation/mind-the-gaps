# ODI insights

Data consent - data protection.
Anonymised data - but geographical. Quite radical. (Keep in mind it‚Äôs potential cause for pushback.)

Conclusion for the council: Hire independent researchers - you‚Äôll get more for your money.
Cost - benefit analysis for the Council. Survey - ethnographic research.

Actions:
- What is a quality of life survey what is it used for?
- Fill in the glossary.
- Present for each option: Who can you reach, is it labour intensive etc
- Connect with the voluntary and charitable sector.
- Testing the survey live: What is the data stream? Is it used? How?
- We suspect it can be used to back bids and negotiations.
Thomas: ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs kind of cool‚Äù :)

Some things are unmeasurable: community engagement (to strengthen in Bristol and to sort of make in Bordeaux)

Ideas:
- Social media citizen sensing - can we invite people to do it? What‚Äôs the share ability.
- Conversational twitter bot.
Value in increasing response rates.

To come: Anna for wording and Patrice for social media - Tom will introduce us to the ODI comms team.
Share our application for the data festival.
