Phil Chan, Strategic Intelligence and Performance Advisor at Bristol City Council – Policy & Strategy.

He is one of the brain behind the analysis of the [Quality of Life Survey][].

> … to confirm what people _mean_.

Sugar is a strong new fight. Some questions about it have been commissionned.

The last and open question of the Survey challenge is to extract unstructured content. Phil is not if we face the same problem.

> It is always _ward data_ which are difficult to obtain.

The City Hall used to have _neighbourhood officers_. Like they still do in Bordeaux. They served the councillors well.

What Phil understands of Mind the Gaps is:

- we try to mix quantitative and quantitative data
- we create correlations with existing data

Can it help design policies? It would be an _intelligences_ which has an impact.

> It is an interesting question, of _translating data into actions_. But can we do that with results?

Community Groups have found the [Quality of Life Survey][] to be useful for bids. They develop around it.

> Rigor is not such a problem.

Policy makers do not necessarily understand _bias_. They _do_ understand numbers.

The [Quality of Life Survey][] does not have questions structured about neighbourhoods.

The _third sector_ is composed by _voluntary organisations_, like Voscur. It is more of a matter of engagement. They run consultaton engagement to decide priorities.

The Consultation Engagement Team is now separated from the Policy & Strategy Team.

> Im am interested in reaching people we usually do not reach. _That_ is interesting. That would influence the Council.

The comparison with other core cities would be interesting, even if they are only in UK.
