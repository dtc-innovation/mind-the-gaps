Thanks for attending this presentation.

It is a summary of the past two weeks of work we have done on the _Mind the Gaps_ project.

Updates will be related to the website updates, re-establishing a connection with Bordeaux as well as how we defined the Product and our Methodology.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/presentations/2018-02-08-odi/slide-02.png" %}

We made major changes to [Mind the Gaps website](https://dtc-innovation.github.io/mind-the-gaps/). The home categorizes our work in various sections: Latest updates, Insights, Interviews, Workshops, Diary and Team Retrospectives.

We added **2 new interviews**:
[John from the Bristol Health Partners](https://dtc-innovation.github.io/mind-the-gaps/2018/01/19/Interview-John-Kellas.html)
and [Patricia from the Jean Golding Institute](https://dtc-innovation.github.io/mind-the-gaps/2018/01/19/Interview-Patricia-Holley.html).

We designed a **mindmap** which starts from the initial project ideas and develops into 3 main axis of exploration.

We listed **project inspirations**: visual inspirations but also in term of well-being and quality of life surveys.

The map depicts the initial start of the project: visualising inequalities in French and British cities.

The research week unfolds our findings and connects them to the second idea of the project: **citizen sensing**. We refine this idea to make it more comparable across France and UK but also in term of _gaps_, where they are, in term of challenges, communication and **lack of soft and qualitative data**.

We had a very good phone call with a Bordeaux councillor.
We also got a chat with the company which provides and designs the Bordeaux Ward diagnosis.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/presentations/2018-02-08-odi/slide-05.png" %}

First conclusion is the diagnosis is very little used in the ward we phoned. Mostly because the population increased quickly. The diagnosis is already outdated and thus, is not accurate with issues, concerns and figures.

That's okay because 4 systems are in use to keep in touch with citizens:

1. direct contact (by phone, city hall antenna)
2. local council, driven by a 40 people working group
3. [theme based concertations](https://participation.bordeaux-metropole.fr/)
4. proximity ambassadors

The latter walk the street and talk to people to get a feeling about what is going on. It is rather unique to us.

We will have a more detailed phone call to know more about how they work,
and how the other wards deal with similar issues.

Bordeaux and Bristol are similar and varies at the same time.

Dealing with deprivation is a mayor priority in Bristol whereas in Bordeaux, this is (re)enforced by [2014 loi de programmation pour la ville et la cohÃ©sion urbaine](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000028636804&categorieLien=id) and City Hall [pacte de cohÃ©sion sociale](http://www.bordeaux.fr/p84376/pacte-de-cohesion-sociale-et-territoriale).

Bristol embraces community-led actions whereas Bordeaux is subject to its city-led working groups.

Well-being is mesured with the quality of life survey in Bristol whereas Bordeaux has its Ward Diagnosis.

Both cities face the same problems (Housing, Transport, Jobs, Costs of living, etc.) and ought to to be a leading _smart city_.

We sketched a lot of our ideas on paper, prototyped an online form and explored what it would look like as an offline artefact.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/presentations/2018-02-08-odi/slide-08.png" %}

Exploring survey themes and form controls.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/presentations/2018-02-08-odi/slide-09.png" %}

Exploring the use of postcards to collect informations.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/presentations/2018-02-08-odi/slide-10.png" %}

Exploring a more conversational approach to form controls.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/presentations/2018-02-08-odi/slide-11.png" %}

Exploring a more conversational approach with an online form.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/presentations/2018-02-08-odi/slide-12.png" %}

It is this moment again when we refine what we think the project is about.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/presentations/2018-02-08-odi/slide-13.png" %}

Mind the Gaps is a thought provoking experiment to bring citizen sensing closer to policy making. It is **a system for open data collection about well-being and inequalities in cities**.

It will invite citizens to paint a more comprehensive picture of their experience of their neighbourhood.

It complements existing robust datasets with qualitative and granular datapoints. This will aim **to stimulate open discussions** and help policy makers build more resilient cities.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/presentations/2018-02-08-odi/slide-14.png" %}

We think the project as a _toolbox_:

- **data**
  - an online+offline form to collect well-being informations
  - a map of what people express
  - a view to inform
- **methodology**
  - to design conversational well-being surveys
  - to run workshops
- **workshops**
  - communities run workshops at meetups
  - community groups run workshops
  - salons for councillors and citizens
  - hackathons to use data in other systems

{% include figure.html src="/assets/presentations/2018-02-08-odi/slide-15.png" %}

It is web based.

The website contains the online questionnaire, offline versions of it, a live feed of the data and links to raw datasets as well as a visual map of the results.

We test this in Bristol (Feb 2018) and Bordeaux (prior to June 2018).

{% include figure.html src="/assets/presentations/2018-02-08-odi/slide-16.png" %}

{% include figure.html src="/assets/presentations/2018-02-08-odi/slide-17.png" %}

By testing in Bristol and Bordeaux we will be able to surface cultural differences.

It provides a free toolbox to run your own surveys about wellbeing and quality of life (as opposed to consultancies).

It adds to the data that is currently collected to inform _smart cities_: how can we foster a people-focused approach?

Its granularity will create rich data sets that avoid the _average_ pitfall in statistics.

It is complementary to existing quantitive data sets.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/presentations/2018-02-08-odi/slide-18.png" %}

This is a way for citizens to collect and access data that is not currently available to them.

It will give people a new opportunity to express their feelings about their neighbourhood.

The data set will allow citizens to connect and mobilise under the things that matter the most in their area. A way to express their â€˜user needsâ€™ as citizens.
It engages the public with the value of data and specifically open data.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/presentations/2018-02-08-odi/slide-19.png" %}

It highlights the value of citizen sensing to Local Government.

It provides the Local Government with a layer of human or qualitative data that they donâ€™t currently have access to.

Provide a live or more up to date data set for them, useful in fast-evolving trends or areas.

It can surface potential issues and can help address priorities to face challenges in budget cuts across the public sector.

In the long term will help instigate a cultural shift within City Halls leading them to trust citizen collected data and release more decision making power to them.
