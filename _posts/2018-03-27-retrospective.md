Here are the questions we asked to ourselves after the end of the day:

1. What did you enjoy the most today?
2. What would you like to change tomorrow?
3. Is there something slowing you down?

- the kindness of the people we interacted with (+1)
- the quick iteration to translate the questionnaire into French
- discovering new neighbourhoods by walking or public transport
