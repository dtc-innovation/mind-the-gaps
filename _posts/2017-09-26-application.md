title:  Project proposal has been sent
---

After an hour-long phone call between _Kevin O'Malley_ (Bristol City Hall) and _Thomas Parisot_, we wrote an [impact map][].

The _impact map_ helped writing the [project proposal][].

We now have to wait for the next stage: a follow-up interview or a rejection.
