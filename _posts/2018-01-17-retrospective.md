Here are the questions we asked to ourselves after the end of the day 3 of our work week:

1. What did you enjoy/are the most proud of today?
2. What did you dislike and how would _you_ improve it ?
3. Any action/things you'd like to do tomorrow?
4. Is there something slowing you down?

# Enjoy

* I enjoyed the whole day! (+1)
* We are getting somewhere :-)
* I really enjoyed this morning session time organisation (separate + group review + initiating the [TimePlanner.csv][])(+1)
* I really enjoyed the bubbliness of [the afternoon session][8-sketches](+1)
* I enjoyed the flow
* We worked well together
* I enjoyed the ideation drawing
* I enjoyed the non-project time in between the Watershed and the dinner time (walk, chat, shower)(+3)
* I enjoyed how the group made me feel more comfortable
* I enjoyed the emotional intelligence / honest talk during the retro.
* I like that we have done such a good job dealing with uncertainty step by step.
* I enjoyed coming home early. We managed time well and were adaptable. We followed our guts and it served us super well.

* I enjoyed the pre-dinner work session, I was able to publish things and I was able to make great use of that time.
* Enjoyed the photo session!

# Dislike / Improve

* I did not enjoy lunchtime because of the language barrier ‚Äì it's not fixable in a way, and the group helped getting a shared understanding
* I was worried to go to Knowles West Centre after lunch ‚Äì we did fix it by staying at the Watershed and with [this workshop][8-sketches]
* I can get lost in complexity, I get anxious about, and I don't know how to talk about it
* I am not sure there is a direct bridge to solve _the_ problem‚Ä¶ I feel it is a good idea, I do not know it is _the_ good idea ‚Äì I'd like to improve how to communicate that
* I lack 30 minutes per day to do some writing down individually ‚Äì I'd like to make some time for that tomorrow
* I felt a bit vulnerable when I had to explain the drawings, I felt I was overexplaining ‚Äì I will trust the exercise more next time because you backed me up, and ask
* I did not drink enough tea‚Ä¶
* I disliked making too much rice! üçö ‚Äî next time, I'll listen to Al(a)in(e)
* I burned my finger baking bread but I'm happy I did it, it gives me confidence to start baking bread again.

# Do

* Data dome! (+1)
* To write down the conclusions of [this afternoon session][8-sketches]
* To start structure Friday demo time (+2)
* Diaries! (+1)
* Community interviews
* Visiting the Knowles West Media Centre
* Solid research, ask the community‚Ä¶?
* A visit to Voscur to get a better sense of how we could help communities with the problems they face and tackle.

# Slowing me down

* I can get lost in complexity, I get anxious about and I don't know how to talk about it
* The wish to partake in group workshops sometimes makes it difficult for me to make time for individual tasks
* Time is not enough
* I fear of making it a shit project
* Choosing the datasets to use‚Ä¶

CLEAR EYES, FULL HEARTS, CAN'T LOSE! :p
