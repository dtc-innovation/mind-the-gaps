Here are the questions we asked to ourselves after the end of the day:

1. What did you enjoy the most today?
2. What would you like to change tomorrow?
3. Is there something slowing you down?


# Enjoy

- our collective planning that resulted in a really productive session of external communications
- learning about the thick+thin data (+1)
- discovering that tech ethnography is a thing
- walking
- finding our way through survey questions
- watching Tricia Wang
- cooking at home for lunch
- writing emails to keep stakeholders up to date
- getting in touch with new people and getting prompt responses
- when we discarded writing questions so as we avoid putting our bias in the survey prototype
- the _aha_ moment on the way back from the cafe, which combines the newly discovered thick data ethnography process and quantitative data

# To change

- communicate visually a bit more
- try to balance caveats and criticism with counter offers
- to reflect more before snapping a prompt and harsh comment
- to ask "are we done yet?" when I feel lost instead of backtracking the conversation

# Slowing me down

- ability to communicate ideas clearly
- the lack of deep sleep of the previous days
