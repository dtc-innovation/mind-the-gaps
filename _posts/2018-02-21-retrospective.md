Here are the questions we asked to ourselves after the end of the day:

1. What did you enjoy the most today?
2. What would you like to change tomorrow?
3. Is there something slowing you down?


# Enjoy

- I'm very excited the website is being completely renovated
- I appreciate Thomas skills in building the website quickly (+1)
- we chose to divide and conquer to get stuff done
- I enjoyed wrangling with words
- it's the _final countdooooown_ (it's thrilling)
- I'm going to be proud to show our work to the ODI (+1)
- enjoyed to have ready made sketches to build the website
- enjoyed the quality of the conversation with the Bordeaux councilor as it translates into a proper public service
- Happy that we have a paper version of the survey on par with what we have online (+1)

# To change

- go to a more quiet space

# Slowing me down

- not enough time
- being slower than I thought on some things
