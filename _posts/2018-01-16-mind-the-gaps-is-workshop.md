The intent of this workshop was to ideate around the goals, the meaning and the representation of what _Mind the Gaps_ is for us.

It works by one of us starting the sentence by "Mind the Gaps is…" and by saying a word. The person next to them would say another word, and so until someone says "fullstop".
When it happens, the sentence is considered as _finished_ and we start a new round of collaborative ideation.

We found out it was a way to have some while thinking hard on how to make sense of what we get from the other participants.
We also found it was a quirky way _to make fun of it_ by forming ridiculous sentences.

* a new commissioned object about bridging gaps amongst inequalities, communities and local authority.
* not about filling(feeling) gaps in the council(s) budget cuts.
* maybe an opportunity to collaborate locally and emotionally to express discrepancies.
* an attempt to fill in representational narratives missing from the mainstream consciousness.
* a comprehensive vision full of testimonies.
* a neutral approach to describe open datasets to a wide population.
* will produce guidelines, bearings and warnings to use rich, wealthy people.

We changed the rules, allowing each other to now say _a word or more_ (if it's an _and_, _a_, etc.):

* tough, because.
* a neutral approach to produce rich datasets containing qualitative community data.
* an interface between how citizens experience inequality and how the council perceives the people feeling these inequalities.

We changed the rules again, allowing each other to say _a part of a sentence_ and to _jump into_ even though it's not our turn:

* should be accessible, collaborative and open source.
* will include handcrafted content, available open datasets and a simple, visual way to understand way
* a beautiful user interface that explains people struggles to be understood and addressed within existing open data frameworks.
* provides informations about actions taken by the council and community initiatives that explain the existing portrait of the situation
