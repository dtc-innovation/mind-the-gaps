Here are the questions we asked to ourselves after the end of the day 4 of our work week:

1. What did you enjoy/are the most proud of today?
2. What did you dislike and how would _you_ improve it ?
3. Any action/things you'd like to do tomorrow?
4. Is there something slowing you down?

# Dislike / Improve

- I disliked the long pause while waiting for the bus
- I disliked the general feeling of being useless
- I disliked the move between the KWMC to the Factory… (not very pleasant)
- The pace of the day was too patchy and I got tired of moving around.
