Thanks for attending this presentation.
We will walk you through our work since we started the project in October,
up until this end of the month (Jan 2018).
We will conclude the presentation with a new direction we are more comfortable with.

The initial proposal of the project takes part in a strand of work of the ODI
which is geared towards connecting and/or encouraging collaborative data innovation between french and british cities.

We envisioned this project with the help of the City of Bristol.
We thought of a datavisualisation which highlight major inequalities alongside
problem-solving resources and the pathways between them all.

We asked Bordeaux to take part to this project. They eventually declined our proposal. Which is fine.

We worked on this project as a _data collective_ with a multidisciplinary approach. We have designers, researchers, facilitators and developers on board.

We started the project with the following principles in mind:

- **Replicable**: it has to work in any city, this can't be specific to the ones we work with
- **Open**: open source, open data, open documentation
- **Accessible and inclusive**: we design with online and offline in mind, with a diverse approach of lifestyles and life conditions
- **Participative and actionable**: we want to design something engaging, based on a user-centred approach which can be effectively used
- **Independant**: although we work with stakeholders, we care about keeping a balance between their needs and citizen needs

We spent an immersive week in Bristol to make sure we were thinking and designing the right thing.

It translates into:

- 5 days living on site
- 10 different places visited
- 10 community interviews
- 9 leaders and stakeholders interviews

We expanded the vision of the project from _local government_, _inequality_ and _open data_.
We recently included _citizen_, _communities_ and _activists_ in our mental landscape.

This week in Bristol led us to think **Bristol is a leading city**.

They are the first UK _smart city_. This is reinforced with the _One City Plan_ and their will to _co-design_ with citizens.

The Quality of Life survey is **unique**. It runs since 2001. It focuses on human data, inequality and also wellbeing.

We also discovered the [Happy City Index](http://www.happycity.org.uk/).
It is run by Bristolians. They prefer to measure the _quality of life_ rather than satisfaction (QoL approach).

One of our conclusion is a _smart city_ is not only _Internet of Things_ sensors but also _citizen sensing_. Data generated and produced by citizen-led initiatives.

Let's talk more about the Quality of Life Survey.

# ODI feedbacks

- What was particularly exciting in the initial proposition was the _highlighting pathways to solutions_ part of Mind the Gaps.
- Understanding why we shifted away from the previous point; our answer is it is highly dependent on context and therefore non-replicable.
The ODI said it is a common endeavor. Mapping why that didn't go through would be useful.
- Our proposal was interesting and they would like to see it develop: they were particularly keen to understand how this would test in Bordeaux.
- They were curious about what the political sensitivities or potential barriers could be.

# Project outputs

At the end of February, _Mind the Gaps_ outputs would be:

* a **rich ethnographic research**
* a **prototype** with user research / signal testing
* a **reflective report** with a clearly outlined research methodology

We're offering to combine the ethnographic research and the report on the website. We will pursue prototyping and user testing as best we can in the time we have left.

It's within the realms of possibility that we might only be able to develop a framework/guidelines to continue the _citizen sensing_ prototype.

The report would stick more closely to the grant brief (_data innovation projects between French/UK cities_).
