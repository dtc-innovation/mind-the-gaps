# ODI feedbacks

- What was particularly exciting in the initial proposition was the _highlighting pathways to solutions_ part of Mind the Gaps.
- Understanding why we shifted away from the previous point; our answer is it is highly dependent on context and therefore non-replicable.
The ODI said it is a common endeavor. Mapping why that didn't go through would be useful.
- Our proposal was interesting and they would like to see it develop: they were particularly keen to understand how this would test in Bordeaux.
- They were curious about what the political sensitivities or potential barriers could be.

# Project outputs

At the end of February, _Mind the Gaps_ outputs would be:

* a **rich ethnographic research**
* a **prototype** with user research / signal testing
* a **reflective report** with a clearly outlined research methodology

We're offering to combine the ethnographic research and the report on the website. We will pursue prototyping and user testing as best we can in the time we have left.

It's within the realms of possibility that we might only be able to develop a framework/guidelines to continue the _citizen sensing_ prototype.

The report would stick more closely to the grant brief (_data innovation projects between French/UK cities_).
