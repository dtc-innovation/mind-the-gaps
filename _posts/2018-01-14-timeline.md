What we did on Sunday, when everybody arrived in Bristol, was to build a mutual comprehension of the events which led to this work week.

There were 4 attendees: Alaine (designer), No√©mie (UX researcher), Romain (developer) and Thomas (developer).

We used tiny and _yellow sticky notes_ to represent _time_. We use square and _pale sticky notes_ to represent _events_.

We wrote down **memorable events** on _pale sticky notes_. We presented them in turn and described them as one added them to the wall. New events came to mind as people spoke.

At the end of the workshop, we had both _documented_ and created a _comprehensive context_ of the project. We would be on par when visiting Bristol City Hall the day after.
