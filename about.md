**Mind the Gaps** is a project funded thanks to a _tender_ organised by the [Open Data Institute (ODI)][]. The project is facilitated by a joint of [dtc innovation][] and [Alaine Burns][].

Its **seed** has been planted during an interview between _Kevin O'Malley_ (Bristol City Hall) and _Thomas Parisot_ (dtc innovation).

Its **intent** is to become an encouraging map aimed at highlighting city inequalities and possible pathways to their resolutions.

We feel more comforable to work in the open with an emerging **approach**.
