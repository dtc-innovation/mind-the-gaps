**Mind the Gaps** is a project funded thanks to a _tender_ organised by the [Open Data Institute (ODI)][]. The project is facilitated by a joint of [dtc innovation][] and [Alaine Burns][].

Its **seed** has been planted during an interview between _Kevin O'Malley_ (Bristol City Hall) and _Thomas Parisot_ (dtc innovation).

Its **intent** is to become an encouraging map aimed at highlighting city inequalities and possible pathways to their resolutions.

We feel more comforable to work in the open with an emerging **approach**.

## Research Week

Our data collective ran a work week in Bristol from Jan 15th to Jan 19th 2018.

The collective was formed of 4 persons:

* [Alaine Burns](https://www.behance.net/OrangegnarO)
* [No√©mie Girard](http://noemiegirard.co)
* [Romain Crestey](https://github.com/ioiurson) ([drawings](https://cargocollective.com/ourson))
* [Thomas Parisot](https://dtc-innovation.org)

## Money Accountability

We value public money and thus, we want to be transparent on how we spent it to develop the project.
