Format: [Lean Coffee](https://plans-for-retrospectives.com/en/?id=51)

Plan:

1. Ask for topics to discuss
2. Prioritise the topics (we didn't vote to select the ones the team needs to discuss first)
3. Talk
4. Define [S.M.A.R.T goals](https://plans-for-retrospectives.com/en/?id=13)

# Catch up

Romain only worked 1 week on the project and had a hard time to catch up because there was many information on the website. It only scanned some pages.

# Gaining confidence

- Romain would not explain the project differently.
- Sketch on the website is the most useful to Romain, as it's very concise. He was looking for the bug picture and thinks that kind of info should be on the homepage. A digital version of the sketches would make them more readable.

# Learned from each other (positives)

- Planning, Braindumping, time tracking.
- Documentation as we go : Google Docs -> website -> public
- Visual communication - Sketching, mindmapping.
- Daily team retros - be heard, active, people read it
- Asking early who are users? Always led us back to conccrete actions
- Working completely together. Keeps us aligned despite the complexity.
- We didn't plan in advance. We only did what we felt was important on the day.
- Field work was super valuable. Going talking ot people. Helps us remove biases. This was not done by the City Hall. A lot of discovery moments. Help us grow our research skills
- Very open about what we want to do. 
- All the feedback given by team members.

# Reflect on work / methods / process

- Morning planning / evening retro -> Time planning tool
- Lot of Workshops
- Field work
- Co-writing
- Mind mapping
- Sketching
- Kanban
- Catch-up with stakeholders. 5,6 face to face. 10, 20 over email.
- Making and testing.
- GitHub platform / Jekyll
- Open Source all the things!

# What have we learned (to do differently)?

- Catching up with the website is difficult. Research page is fine but the website lacks some critical information about the project in general.
- Less efficient working with 4 people. Better with two.
- Remote work from Bordeaux? 
- Romain is not sure to do further research.
- Could Morning routine be more effective? (can take 30 min to 1 hour). We start slow, but once we feel better, then everything moves very quickly.
- Generate Kanban records and datasets
- Communication with stakeholders (ODI)
- Clearer rules of interactions (gains, workshops). Things take too long to complete.
- Internal conflicts, find ways to not be dismissive, ask questions instead.
- Am I Useful? Need some time for alone thinking, process thoughts.
- Try to offer alternatives.
- Speak up sooner.

# Develop the toolbox

- How do we engage with communities group?
- How do we engage with a new city?
- Survey is not done yet. Needs more user-testing.
- Convince founders : prove it's a good idea, have people use it . Already 100 responses.
- Why should people answer the survey? Should we promote it online? Twitter? Google Ads?

# Get the project in the open

- Improving the website - refine description, information architecture.
- Refine the sketch - Digital poster
- Review the website with external people (UX testing with friends)
- How to use the data?

# Other comments

* Getting Romain involved on the Bordeaux site? Focus on Bristol first?
