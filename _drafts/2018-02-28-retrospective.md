# Catch up

Sketch on the website is the most useful to Romain. It's very concise.

# Gaining confidence

Romain would not explain the project differently

# Learned from each other (positives)

Planning. Braindumping / time tracking

Documentation as we go : Google Docs -> website -> public

Visual communication - Sketching, mindmapping.

Daily team retros - be heard, active, people read it

Asking early who are users? Always led us back to conccrete actions

Working completely together. Keeps us aligned despite the complexity.

We didn't plan in advance. We only didi what we felt was important on the day.

Field work was super valuable. Going talking ot people. Helps us remove biases. This was not done by the City Hall. A lot of discovery moments. Help us grow our research skills

Very open about what we want to do. 

All the feedback given by team members.

# What have we learned (to do differently)?

Catching up with the website is difficult. Research page is fine but the website lacks some critical information about the project in general.

Less efficient working with 4 people. Better with two.

Remote work from Bordeaux? 

Romain is not sure to do further research.

We start slow, but once we feel better, then everything moves very quickly.

Morning routine (30min to 1 hour)

Kanban records and dataset

Communication with stakeholders (ODI)

Clearer rules of interactions (gains, workshops). Things take too long ot complete.

Internal conflicts, find ways ot be not dismissive, ask questions.

Useful? Time for alone thinking.

Try to offer alternatives.

Speak up sooner.

# Develop the toolbox

How do we engage with comunities group?

How do we engage with a new city?

Survey is not done yet. Needs more user-testing.

Convince founders : prove it's a good idea, have people use it . Already 100 responses.

Why should people answer the survey? Should we promote it online? Twitter? Google Ads?

# Get the project in the open

Improving the website - refine Description

Refine the sketch - Digital poster

Review the website with external people (friends)

How to use the data?

# Other comments

Getting Romain involved on the Bordeaux site? Focus on Bristol first.

Confidently
