Looking at qualitative and quantitative data

After spending time with the local council in Bristol we realised that the open data sources that were available from them were not detailed enough to build the original mind the gaps data visualisation.

From what we had seen and heard the local government collected a lot of big data or hard data. This was collected as part of the day-to-day activities of the council and due to data ethics and privacy was not made open and available for public use.
Speaking with the Citizens of Bristol on the street most people did not know what open data was. Citizens also had no idea what the smart city was.  we noticed that almost every citizen we interviewed really liked living in Bristol but at the same time felt there were some challenges to be overcome.

Speaking to Phil Chan who ran the quality of life survey within the local government there we understood there was a need for local government and citizens to share information about the life of people in Bristol but width cuts to funding the survey was becoming less and less robust. We felt that the information collected in the survey was largely to answer questions within local government rather than to facilitate solving issues for Citizens. The data collected by the quality of life team was also not open data.  the answers to the questions in the survey amounted to a quantitative data set.

We decided that one of the things that was missing as a link between the lives of Citizens and the information that local governments have access to is qualitative.

Qualitative data  is usually based on citizen interviews it is rich and personal. It embraces the full story of people's experiences.  it is usually collected on a face-to-face and one to one interview method.  this makes it time consuming to collect. On top of this as the interviews need to be transcribed and analysed by a sociologists as not referred or coded by an expensive computer system it means it's expensive to process.

We decided if we could come up with a service that sat between the quantitative methods of the quality of life survey and the rich ethnographic insights that could be collected from a qualitative study, we could create something useful for both local government and citizens.  if we could develop a toolbox with 0 running costs it could also be replicable in Bordeaux and in fact any City across the world.
