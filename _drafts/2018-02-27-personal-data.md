title: Why not asking personal data?

the only form of id is neighbouhood
no gender, no age, no ethnicity
we do not want to lower a response value because of some personal data
if someone is "too old" or "too young", we don't want that person judgement/opinion to be put aside

you will never know about people age
they are all equal on data side of things
removing bias and skewed analysis with our own bias

it does not make a difference with how you perceive your neighbourhood
 
if you would have a certain demographic, about something specific (safety by night)
we could not be able to segment
it enables this but it prevents that
 
it is not a great user experience to self define ourselves
project is more about communicating signals that  
embracing geo accurate data

the data we get are subjective enough
it's about removing another layer of subjective reading

these data are already collecting in other surveys
this is not the point of this work

**conclusion**
we are considered as equals at the survey/form level directly
it's built in, it is by design
