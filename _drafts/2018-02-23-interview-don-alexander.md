History of local government in the UK - 1950-60-70 - post-war era. A lot of money into local government, housing and such things.
Thatcherism + financial crash in 2008 and following on, there has been an enormous withdrawal of funds.
People who are not politically connected but dependant on those services are struggling to understand why the council no longer has the capacity to serve them as they used to.

Shortage of money but also ideologically driven: 
Encourage community, strengthen community groups to relate to us more.

It’s not a very devolved country, unlike other European countries. Very centralised on London.
Don’t want to go back to municipal delivery.
Communities should decide what they want and do business with us.

Community groups in each area - first step
Working class would not tend to form groups that are like middle class 

4 basic community groups (meet once a month, use them how they can use the council services / digital tools) - help them on planning and as a group to interface with the council.

People who live near the park should get together to discuss the maintenance of the park, (play area, furniture, growing wild flowers to pollinate etc)
Develop their capacity to do that. Relate to one community ambassador because the council needs to simplify interface.

Council has responsibility for health and safety - help with fundraising and consultation

70 councillors in Bristol. My ward is 3 councillors (2 from his party and 1 from another party).
On Community activities it works pretty well.

Members of Parliament - £80K and 4 members of staff
Councillors - £12K and no staff. We have to earn our respect.

Community development people who work for the Council - 2 people who appear occasionally.
Encourage walking groups for old people - identify social needs.
Social workers

Large charitable sector. Voluntary sector - Voscur. 
Charities are not locally based.

Consultations - mixture of channels (digital, paper, face to face) it depends on the demographic.
People in middle class areas 
Result is always skewed. 
Consultations 

Community group - interface - joint, collegiate view and bring that to the council.

They’ll already have started the thinking rather than having someone who’s just angry about something.

Some are quite small. Estate of 1000, 8-9 show up.
British don’t socialise geographically much. It’s much more based on interests.
