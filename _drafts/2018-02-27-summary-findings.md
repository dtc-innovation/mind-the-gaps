what a quality of life survey is? What it hopes to achieve? How it's used?

what a quality of life survey is?
it is a source for metrics which may or may not drive budget and policy decisions.
it provides geographically refined data
categories: health and wellbeing, community and living, council and democracy, crime and safety, educ and skills, sustainability and environment, culture and leisure, transfport, housing
it can be run by a local government, national or by private organisations

What it hopes to achieve?
evidence based decision making

How it's used?
it's boiled down to metrics which are passed around local gov to drive policy decisions or budget allocation
At least at a local council level

# deprived areas

you can't describe how affluent a place
you can find a deprived area but not the most deprived people


# averages and gaps in the data

LSOA in the same ward, you can have very wealthy and very poor, makes it average
you can miss the real picture just by using the wrong granularity

# accessibility

in terms of reaching people, from all ages and all backgrounds, abilities
free and open tools to measure quality of life (like for Knowle West)
computer litteracy: you can use a computer and not feel comfortable to answer
some people don't think about these questions, so it takes them more effort to give an answer

# mixed methods

field work, people on the ground
especially in deprived area, the power of just having a chat

# the well-being side of things

we found out the councils are not that data driven and dont have much resources to change things
just giving a space to vent and to be heard

# the blend of data types

how we started thinking bridging quantit and quali insights

# user experience of the survey

anonymised
quick and short
when people are available

# releasing the grip of power

local gov seems themselves as authorities on data collection
as a result they don't trust citizen sensed data as much (eg: home damps)
faith in numbers but less in small samples but valuable insights

# smart city sensing

people don't know about open data
people don't know about smart city

# community based data collection

our ambition is to create a participatory experience
that's where local gov want to encourage (easier to get people together and to empower the communities to make it a better interface with local gov)
that's where we can be trusted to ask these questions
