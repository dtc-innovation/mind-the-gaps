To kick off the mind the gaps project we went to Bristol where we embarked on a week-long ethnographic study of but open data landscape there.  we interviewed people ranging from citizens to local government civil servants and leaders of various community organisations.  On top of this we went along to an opened data Meetup to meet local data  enthusiasts. 
As we were researching the people and the open data terrain in Bristol we were developing our mind the gaps toolbox as the research was happening.

We were asking people as we met them how they thought the idea of the mind the gap stools could help them how they thought it could work for them and how they thought it could connect there work with the work of other people in the community.  this was the start of the co-design process.

Built into the nature of our interviews were questions about how the open data to rain in Bristol could be built on how could be improved how could be more inclusive.
Combining the three key elements of our work; ethnographic research, design and development of a open toolbox, a deep consideration of how the open data terrain could be changed and developed,this amounted our methods and processes to a participatory action research project.

Participatory action research is a method of instigating meaningful change in communities where the research phase and the design and development phase are combined. This differs to all your methods where research is conducted and concluded with steps for action.  Participatory action research has links to the agile methods used by coders, developers and tech startups in general  as well as the iterative design process that has developed out of the design thinking movement.
