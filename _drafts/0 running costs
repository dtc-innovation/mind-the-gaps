Why is it important that the Toolbox has zero running costs?

We believe it is a useful tool for citizens. It is useful because it is open and exists in the commons.
If some costs are associated with this there are two main problems for us:
1. The projects dies at the end of this round of funding.
2. It may be influenced or nudged by funders.

This was developed with Local Government and they explicitly told us they have no funds for a project like this for two reasons:
1. They value quant data, numbers over soft data points.
2. They are cutting costs in the collection of this kind of data.

How do we make this happen?

We rely on free and simple features of widely used products; github, google drive, slack, typeform, netlify.

Doing an Open Source project within a Not-for-Profit company unlocks premium features of the above listed products to us for free.

Co-Design with Communities
Involving City Hall, community leaders and citizens in the design and development process right from the start means the project can spread naturally, without promotion. The tool box has been built with them for them.

The domain name is the only running cost. Priced at £6 per year it is viable.

Governance
People trust us because we are independant and free.
As we are sustainable by being free.
As we don't have to ask people for even £1, they are happy to participate in our project. They are giving us time and information without a thought.
Being commercial was a real barrier to people sharing with us.

Some of the benefits of working this way...

From a design perspective we are free to move to whatever works best for our needs as we are not locked into services we have paid for.

Project pace
We can embrace the fact that good things take time. As we are not locked in to a product plan for a set time period. We can go and work on other projects to sustain our lives while the next funding opportunity arises and we can continue working where we left off.
