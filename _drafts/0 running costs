Why is it important that the Toolbox has zero running costs?

We belive it is a usefull tool for citezens. It is useful because it is open and existises in the commons.
If some costs are associated with this there are two main problems for us:
1. The projects dies at the end of this round of funding.
2. It may be influnced or nudged by funders.

This was developed with Local Government and they explicitly told us they have no funds for a project like this for tow reasons:
1. They value quant data, numbers over soft data points.
2. They are cutting costs in the collection of the data with generates the metrics in whice they review there preformance.
